# Use Case Guides

Practical guides for real-world applications of the Danish Parliament API. These guides show you how to build solutions for common parliamentary data analysis and monitoring needs.

## Available Guides

### ðŸ“œ [Voting Analysis](voting-analysis/)
Track and analyze parliamentary voting patterns, party alignments, and individual politician voting records.

- Track how politicians vote on specific issues
- Analyze party unity and dissent patterns
- Compare voting records across periods
- Export voting data for statistical analysis

### ðŸ“œ [Legislative Tracking](legislative-tracking/)
Monitor the progress of bills and proposals through the legislative process.

- Follow bills from proposal to law
- Track committee work and amendments
- Monitor document flows and updates
- Set up alerts for case progress

### Ã¸ [Real-Time Monitoring](real-time-monitoring/)
Build systems that react to parliamentary activity as it happens.

- Detect changes using polling strategies
- Handle daily parliamentary updates efficiently
- Implement webhook-like notifications
- Cache and synchronize data effectively

### =, [Advanced Analysis](advanced-analysis/)
Complex analytical techniques for deep parliamentary insights.

- Network analysis of political relationships
- Timeline visualization of legislative processes
- Data mining for patterns and trends
- Machine learning applications

## Getting Started

Each guide includes:
- **Overview** - What you'll build and learn
- **Prerequisites** - Required knowledge and setup
- **Step-by-step instructions** - Detailed implementation guide
- **Complete code examples** - Working implementations in Python/JavaScript
- **Best practices** - Production-ready patterns

## Choose Your Path

### For Journalists and Researchers
Start with **[Voting Analysis](voting-analysis/)** to understand political dynamics and **[Legislative Tracking](legislative-tracking/)** to follow specific issues.

### For Developers
Begin with **[Real-Time Monitoring](real-time-monitoring/)** for building responsive applications and explore **[Advanced Analysis](advanced-analysis/)** for complex data processing.

### For Political Organizations
Focus on **[Legislative Tracking](legislative-tracking/)** to monitor relevant legislation and **[Voting Analysis](voting-analysis/)** to understand voting patterns.

## Common Patterns

All guides follow these principles:

1. **Efficient Querying** - Minimize API calls using smart filters
2. **Data Caching** - Store frequently accessed data locally
3. **Change Detection** - Use `opdateringsdato` for incremental updates
4. **Error Handling** - Gracefully handle API limitations
5. **Pagination** - Process large datasets systematically
