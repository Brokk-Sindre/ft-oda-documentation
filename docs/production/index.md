# Production Deployment

Essential guidance for deploying applications that consume the Danish Parliament API in production environments. Learn how to build robust, scalable, and reliable systems.

## Production Considerations

### <× [Architecture](architecture/)
Design patterns and infrastructure considerations for production deployments.

- **[Scaling](architecture/scaling.md)** - Handle high traffic and large datasets
- **[Caching](architecture/caching.md)** - Implement effective caching strategies
- **[Monitoring](architecture/monitoring.md)** - Track API usage and system health

### = [Security](security/)
Security best practices for production systems using the API.

- **[HTTPS/TLS](security/https-tls.md)** - Secure communication protocols
- **[No Authentication](security/no-auth.md)** - Working with open APIs securely
- **[Rate Limiting](security/rate-limiting.md)** - Implement client-side throttling

### ¡ [Performance](performance/)
Optimize your application for production workloads.

- **[Query Optimization](performance/query-optimization.md)** - Write efficient OData queries
- **[Pagination Strategies](performance/pagination-strategies.md)** - Handle large datasets
- **[Concurrent Requests](performance/concurrent-requests.md)** - Parallel processing patterns

### =' [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting/)
Diagnose and resolve common production issues.

- **[Common Errors](troubleshooting/common-errors.md)** - Error patterns and solutions
- **[Diagnostic Commands](troubleshooting/diagnostic-commands.md)** - Debug API issues
- **[Support](troubleshooting/support.md)** - Get help when needed

## Production Checklist

Before going to production, ensure you have:

### Infrastructure
- [ ] **HTTPS enforcement** - All API calls use HTTPS
- [ ] **Error handling** - Graceful degradation for API failures
- [ ] **Logging system** - Track API calls and responses
- [ ] **Monitoring alerts** - Detect issues proactively
- [ ] **Backup strategy** - Cache critical data locally

### Performance
- [ ] **Query optimization** - Use `$select` to minimize data transfer
- [ ] **Pagination implementation** - Handle 100-record limit
- [ ] **Caching layer** - Reduce redundant API calls
- [ ] **Rate limiting** - Respect API resources
- [ ] **Connection pooling** - Reuse HTTP connections

### Reliability
- [ ] **Retry logic** - Handle transient failures
- [ ] **Circuit breakers** - Prevent cascade failures
- [ ] **Health checks** - Monitor API availability
- [ ] **Fallback data** - Serve cached data during outages
- [ ] **Update detection** - Use `opdateringsdato` efficiently

## Key Metrics to Monitor

### API Performance
- Response times (target: <2s for complex queries)
- Error rates (4xx and 5xx responses)
- Data freshness (lag from parliamentary activity)
- Query complexity (number of expansions)

### Application Health
- Cache hit rates (target: >80% for static data)
- Memory usage (watch for large dataset processing)
- Request queuing (avoid overwhelming the API)
- Data synchronization lag

## Best Practices

### 1. Implement Smart Caching
```python
# Cache with TTL based on data type
cache_ttl = {
    'Periode': 86400,      # 24 hours - rarely changes
    'Sagstype': 86400,     # 24 hours - static
    'Sag': 3600,           # 1 hour - updates frequently
    'Afstemning': 300      # 5 minutes - very dynamic
}
```

### 2. Use Connection Pooling
```python
import requests
from requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter

session = requests.Session()
session.mount('https://', HTTPAdapter(pool_connections=10, pool_maxsize=10))
```

### 3. Implement Exponential Backoff
```python
import time

def retry_with_backoff(func, max_retries=3):
    for i in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return func()
        except Exception as e:
            if i == max_retries - 1:
                raise
            time.sleep(2 ** i)  # Exponential backoff
```

## Common Production Patterns

### Data Synchronization
- Poll for changes every 5-15 minutes
- Use `opdateringsdato` for incremental updates
- Maintain local database for complex queries
- Implement conflict resolution for concurrent updates

### High Availability
- Deploy across multiple regions
- Use CDN for static content
- Implement database replication
- Design for eventual consistency

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling with load balancers
- Microservices for specific API entities
- Queue-based processing for bulk operations
- Serverless functions for event-driven updates

## Next Steps

1. Review **[Architecture](architecture/)** patterns for your use case
2. Implement **[Security](security/)** best practices
3. Optimize with **[Performance](performance/)** guidelines
4. Prepare **[Troubleshooting](troubleshooting/)** procedures
