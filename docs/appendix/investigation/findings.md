### 4. Feature Completeness Analysis

**OData 3.0 Implementation:**

| Feature | Status | Capability |
|---------|---------|------------|
| $select |  Fully Supported | Field-level data selection |
| $expand |  Fully Supported | Multi-level relationship expansion |
| $filter |  Advanced Support | Complex query conditions |
| $orderby |  Fully Supported | Multi-field sorting |
| $top/$skip |  Paginated | 100-record maximum per request |
| $inlinecount |  Fully Supported | Total record counts |
| $format |  JSON/XML | Multiple response formats |

**Advanced Capabilities:**

- **Complex Filtering**: Date functions, string operations, logical combinations
- **Metadata Discovery**: Complete schema available via $metadata endpoint
- **File System Integration**: Direct document download with authentication bypass

### 5. Silent Failure Patterns and Critical Issues

**Identified Issues:**

1. **Misleading HTTP Headers**
   - `Allow` headers advertise POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE support
   - **Reality**: All write operations return HTTP 501 (Not Implemented)
   - **Impact**: Developers may attempt unsupported operations

2. **URL Encoding Requirement**
   - **Critical**: Must use `%24` instead of `$` for OData parameters
   - **Failure Mode**: Using `$` in URLs causes query parameter loss
   - **Solution**: Always URL-encode OData syntax

3. **Empty Entity Traps**
   - **EUsag**: Contains zero records despite valid schema
   - **Sambehandlinger**: Returns null responses (deeper dysfunction)
   - **Impact**: Developers may build features around non-functional entities

4. **Pagination Limit Discovery**
   - **Current Limit**: Hard cap at 100 records per request
   - **Previous Behavior**: Earlier investigation showed 1,000-record success
   - **Implication**: API configuration may have changed or is dynamically adjusted

### 6. Exceptional Characteristics and Unique Capabilities

**Global Differentiators:**

1. **Zero Authentication Barriers**
   - No API keys, registration, or approval required
   - Immediate access to complete parliamentary database
   - Global availability without geographic restrictions

2. **Individual Vote Granularity**

4. **Semantic Relationship Mapping**
   - 23 distinct case-actor role types
   - Parliamentary procedure documentation through entity relationships
   - Committee system and meeting structure fully exposed

### 7. Comparison with Global Parliamentary Standards

**International Benchmarking:**

| Feature | Danish Parliament | Typical Parliament APIs |
|---------|------------------|----------------------|
| Authentication | None Required | API Keys, OAuth, Registration |
| Data Volume | 96K+ cases, 18K+ actors | Hundreds to low thousands |
| Historical Depth | 74+ years | 5-20 years |

### 10. Recommendations for Users and Developers

#### For Developers

**Production Implementation Guidelines:**

```javascript
// Recommended pagination strategy
async function fetchAllRecords(entity, maxRecords = 10000) {
    const batchSize = 100; // API maximum
    let allRecords = [];
    let skip = 0;
    
    while (skip < maxRecords) {
        const url = `https://oda.ft.dk/api/${entity}?%24top=${batchSize}&%24skip=${skip}`;
        const response = await fetch(url);
        const data = await response.json();
        
        if (!data.value.length) break;
        allRecords.push(...data.value);
        skip += batchSize;
        
        // Respectful delay
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
    }
    return allRecords;
}
```

**Critical Implementation Notes:**

1. **Always use `%24` instead of `$`** in OData parameters
2. **Maximum 100 records per request** - implement pagination for larger datasets
3. **Ignore Allow headers** - API is strictly read-only despite header claims
4. **Focus on active entities**: Avoid EUsag and Sambehandlinger (empty/dysfunctional)
5. **Implement change detection** using opdateringsdato timestamps

#### For Researchers

**Data Access Strategy:**

1. **Start with Core Entities**
   - **Sag**: Parliamentary cases and legislation
   - **Aktør**: Politicians and institutional actors  
   - **Afstemning**: Voting sessions and outcomes
   - **Stemme**: Individual vote records

2. **Historical Analysis Approach**
   - Use Periode entity for temporal segmentation
   - Filter by opdateringsdato for data freshness analysis
   - Leverage Møde entity for session-based research

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Batch queries during off-peak hours
   - Implement local caching for frequently accessed data
   - Use $select to minimize response payload

#### For Policy Makers
