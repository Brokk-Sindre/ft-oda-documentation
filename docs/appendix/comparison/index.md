### OData Implementation Analysis

The Danish API's **strict OData 3.0 compliance** distinguishes it from peers using proprietary formats:

#### Standards Compliance

-  **Complete OData 3.0**: Full specification implementation
-  **Consistent URL Patterns**: Standard entity navigation
-  **Proper HTTP Semantics**: Correct status codes and headers  
-  **Metadata Exposure**: Full schema documentation via $metadata
- Â  **Modern Features Limited**: No OData 4.0+ capabilities ($compute, $apply)

#### Query Capability Matrix

| Feature | Danish API | Industry Average | Notes |
|---------|------------|------------------|-------|
| Basic Filtering |  Full |  Full | Standard $filter support |
| Complex Boolean Logic |  Full | Â  Partial | AND/OR combinations work perfectly |
| Entity Expansion |  2-level | Â  1-level | $expand with relationship traversal |
| Pagination |  Unlimited | Â  Limited | No practical $skip/$top limits |
| Aggregation | L None | Â  Partial | OData 3.0 limitation |
| Full-Text Search |  substringof() |  Varies | Function-based text search |

## Key Differentiators

### Unique Strengths

**1. Zero Barrier Access Model**

## Best Practices for API Evaluation

### Essential Assessment Criteria

**1. Accessibility Testing**
```bash
# Test authentication requirements
curl -I "https://api-endpoint.gov/data"

# Verify geographic restrictions  
curl --proxy international-proxy:8080 "https://api-endpoint.gov/data"

# Check rate limiting
for i in {1..10}; do curl "https://api-endpoint.gov/data"; done
```

**2. Performance Benchmarking**
```bash
# Measure response times
time curl "https://api-endpoint.gov/data?limit=100"

# Test concurrent requests
ab -n 100 -c 10 "https://api-endpoint.gov/data"

# Evaluate large dataset handling
curl "https://api-endpoint.gov/data?limit=10000" | wc -l
```

**3. Feature Completeness Validation**
```bash
# Test filtering capabilities
curl "https://api-endpoint.gov/data?filter=field eq 'value'"

# Verify relationship expansion
curl "https://api-endpoint.gov/data?expand=related_entity"

# Check metadata availability
curl "https://api-endpoint.gov/metadata"
```
