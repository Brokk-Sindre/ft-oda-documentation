- Committee referral patterns show collaborative governance approach

### Democratic Accountability
- Question-answer cycle statuses (IDs 20, 50, 62) enable accountability tracking
- Multiple reading stages ensure thorough consideration
- Withdrawal and lapse options maintain process integrity

### Historical Consistency
- Status semantics maintained across decades
- Granular tracking enables sophisticated process analysis
- Real-time updates provide current parliamentary state

## Conclusion

The 68-status Sagsstatus system represents the most sophisticated parliamentary process tracking system in any democratic API. This granular classification enables:

- **Complete process visibility** from proposal to final decision
- **Detailed workflow analysis** of parliamentary procedures
- **Democratic accountability tracking** through question-answer cycles
- **Process efficiency measurement** via timing and progression analysis
- **Historical legislative research** with consistent status semantics

The complexity of this system reflects the sophistication of Danish parliamentary democracy and provides researchers, journalists, and citizens with unprecedented insight into how democratic processes actually function in practice.
